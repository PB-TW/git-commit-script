# git-commit-script

When joining the team, please add your name and email together with an unused shorthand to the `./scripts/git/contributors.csv`, for example:
`jd,John Doe,john.doe@vendor.com`

Make sure, that at the end of the `./scripts/git/contributors.csv` file, there is an empty line!

To use the commit script, `git add` the files you want to commit, run `./scripts/git/commit.sh` (or `./commit.sh` if you are in the same folder as the script), then follow the instructions.
